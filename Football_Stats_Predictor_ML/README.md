# Football Stats ML Practice Project
I asked chatGPT if it could help me start a project to get good at ML.
I chose the subject of football bc I like soccer and would enjoy implementing it in this way.
I got this response:

Certainly! Let's embark on a project to analyze European soccer data using Python. 
This hands-on approach will enhance your data analysis skills and deepen your understanding of soccer statistics.

## 1. Acquire the Dataset:

Begin by downloading the European Soccer Database from Kaggle. This dataset includes over 25,000 matches and 10,000 players from 11 European countries, offering a rich source for analysis.

## 2. Set Up Your Python Environment:

Ensure you have Python installed along with essential libraries for data analysis:

Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
SQLite3: For database interaction.
Install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:

```commandline
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn sqlite3

```

## 3. Load the Data:

The dataset is in SQLite format. Use Python's sqlite3 library to connect to the database and load data into Pandas DataFrames:

```commandline
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.sqlite')

# Load tables into Pandas DataFrames
matches_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM Match;", conn)
players_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM Player;", conn)

# Close the connection
conn.close()

```

## 4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify potential areas for analysis:

```commandline
# Display the first few rows of the matches DataFrame
print(matches_df.head())

# Display the column names and data types
print(matches_df.info())

# Summary statistics
print(matches_df.describe())

```

## 5. Analyze Team Performance:

Calculate metrics such as win rates, goals scored, and goals conceded for each team:

```commandline
# Calculate total goals scored by each team
home_goals = matches_df.groupby('home_team_api_id')['home_team_goal'].sum()
away_goals = matches_df.groupby('away_team_api_id')['away_team_goal'].sum()

# Combine home and away goals
team_goals = home_goals.add(away_goals, fill_value=0)

# Calculate total goals conceded by each team
home_conceded = matches_df.groupby('home_team_api_id')['away_team_goal'].sum()
away_conceded = matches_df.groupby('away_team_api_id')['home_team_goal'].sum()

# Combine home and away conceded goals
team_conceded = home_conceded.add(away_conceded, fill_value=0)

# Calculate win rates
home_wins = matches_df[matches_df['home_team_goal'] > matches_df['away_team_goal']].groupby('home_team_api_id').size()
away_wins = matches_df[matches_df['away_team_goal'] > matches_df['home_team_goal']].groupby('away_team_api_id').size()

# Combine home and away wins
team_wins = home_wins.add(away_wins, fill_value=0)

# Calculate total matches played
home_matches = matches_df.groupby('home_team_api_id').size()
away_matches = matches_df.groupby('away_team_api_id').size()

# Combine home and away matches
team_matches = home_matches.add(away_matches, fill_value=0)

# Calculate win rate
team_win_rate = team_wins / team_matches

# Create a DataFrame to display the results
team_stats = pd.DataFrame({
    'Goals Scored': team_goals,
    'Goals Conceded': team_conceded,
    'Matches Played': team_matches,
    'Win Rate': team_win_rate
})

# Sort by Win Rate
team_stats = team_stats.sort_values(by='Win Rate', ascending=False)

print(team_stats)

```

## 6. Visualize the Data:

Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that help interpret the data:

```commandline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plot Win Rates
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(x=team_stats.index, y=team_stats['Win Rate'])
plt.title('Win Rates of European Soccer Teams')
plt.xlabel('Team ID')
plt.ylabel('Win Rate')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.show()

# Plot Goals Scored vs. Goals Conceded
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.scatterplot(x=team_stats['Goals Scored'], y=team_stats['Goals Conceded'])
plt.title('Goals Scored vs. Goals Conceded')
plt.xlabel('Goals Scored')
plt.ylabel('Goals Conceded')
plt.show()

```

## 7. Advanced Analysis:

For more in-depth analysis, consider:

Player Performance: Analyze individual player statistics such as goals scored, assists, and playing time.
Match Outcomes Prediction: Develop models to predict match outcomes based on historical data.
Seasonal Trends: Examine how team performance varies across different seasons.
