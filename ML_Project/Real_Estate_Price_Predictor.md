# Project: Predicting Housing Prices

You'll build a machine learning model to predict home prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

Steps:

1. Load Data – Use a real estate dataset (from Kaggle or Zillow API). (2/28/2024 - currently at this step...)
2. Explore the Data – Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Seaborn.
3. Feature Engineering – Handle missing data, convert categorical features, and scale numerical features.
4. Train a Model – Use a regression algorithm (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
5. Evaluate the Model – Use RMSE, R², and cross-validation to measure accuracy.
6. Optimize the Model – Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.
7. (Optional) Deploy – Create a simple Flask web app where users input details to get price predictions.
