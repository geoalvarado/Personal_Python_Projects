## Project: Predicting Aircraft Engine Thrust Using Machine Learning
This project will help you learn regression techniques, model evaluation, and data preprocessing, all within an aerospace-related dataset.

Steps:

1. Data Collection: Use an open-source dataset or generate synthetic engine thrust data with relevant parameters (e.g., altitude, temperature, fuel flow).

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize relationships between variables using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

4. Model Selection: Train different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

5. Model Evaluation: Compare models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and RÂ² score.

6. Optimization: Tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

7. Deployment (Optional): Convert the model into a simple Flask API for real-world usability.
